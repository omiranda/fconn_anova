Here we'll describe the outputs generated by the example using longitudinal data. 
As mentioned before, the function will save figures and data in the **output_folder**:

```
.
|____main_analysis
|____planB_by_networks
|____figures_by_network
```

On these folders, you will see that the files have several key elements on their names:

- **groups**:  For example, some files will have the group names (age, treatment, etc). Files corresponding to interactions will have the groups tested together. 
- **p values**: The string `_p_th_0_05' or '_p_th_1_00' indicates that the results correspond to a *p value* of 0.05 or 1.00, respectively. Notice that the *dot* is replaced with *_*. The threshold value is defined in the options. 
- **correction for multiple comparisons**: The string '_corrected_flag_1' and '_corrected_flag_0' are used to indicate that the results are corrected or not for multiple comparisons, respectively. Notice the flag is treated as binary: 1 for yes and 0 for no.


## main_analysis

This folder contains the result for the main analysis, ie when all the connectivity values are used for the repeated measures anova. 

## planB_by_networks

## figures_by_network
