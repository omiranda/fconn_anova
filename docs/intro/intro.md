**fconn anova** is a package designed to identify differences in functional connectivity between groups. It works in cross-sectional and longitudinal samples. As a prerrequisite, you need to have connectivity matrices where the Regions of Interest (ROIs) can be grouped into different functional networks, such as Gordon[<sup>1</sup>](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25316338/).

To make connectivity matrices you can use the [GUI environments](https://gui-environments-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GUI_environments/).
